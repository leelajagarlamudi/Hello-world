# Hello-world
First repository
I am new for Git and learning about things in GitHub.
So excited!!!
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
readme-edits is new branch,A new branch called feature (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch)!
